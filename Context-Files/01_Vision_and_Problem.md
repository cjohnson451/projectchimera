# File 01: Vision and Problem Statement

## 1. The Burning Pain
Our target users are struggling with three core issues:
- **Alpha Decay**: Generating consistent, uncorrelated returns (alpha) is increasingly difficult due to market efficiency and competition. Traditional research methods are slow and prone to human bias.
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Small to mid-sized funds lack the resources to build and maintain institutional-grade quantitative research and risk management infrastructure. Their portfolio managers (PMs) and analysts spend too much time on low-value data wrangling and not enough on high-level strategy.
- **The "Black Box" Problem**: Existing AI solutions are often opaque "black boxes." Funds are hesitant to trust them with capital allocation, and more importantly, they cannot justify the model's decisions to their investors or regulators.

## 2. Target Users
Our beachhead market is **small to mid-sized hedge funds** (AUM $50M - $2B).
- **Primary User Persona**: The Portfolio Manager (PM) or Chief Investment Officer (CIO).
- **Key Characteristics**: They are sophisticated investors, under immense pressure to perform, but are resource-constrained compared to multi-billion dollar giants. They are digitally savvy and actively seeking a technological edge but lack the budget for a 20-person quant team.

## 3. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
**Project Chimera provides a transparent, multi-agent AI investment team-as-a-service, enabling funds to institutionalize their research process and enhance alpha generation at a fraction of the cost of building an in-house quant desk.**

Our 10x differentiator is **Explainable AI (XAI) through Agent-Based Reasoning**. Instead of a single, black-box prediction, our platform provides a complete, auditable "investment memo" generated by a team of specialized AI agents, making the reasoning behind every trade decision transparent and trustworthy.
