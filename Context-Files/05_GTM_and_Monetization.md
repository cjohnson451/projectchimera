# File 05: Go-to-Market and Monetization

## 1. Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy

- **Beachhead Segment**: Focus relentlessly on US-based long/short equity hedge funds with AUM between $50M and $500M.
- **Distribution Channels**:
    1.  **Direct Sales**: A founder-led sales process involving high-touch demos for target fund managers.
    2.  **Content Marketing**: Publish high-quality research and white papers on AI in asset management, backtested strategies, and the "Explainable AI" thesis to build credibility.
    3.  **Partnerships**: Engage with prime brokers, fund administrators, and outsourced trading desks who serve our target clientele. They can provide warm introductions.

## 2. Monetization Model
We will use a tiered **B2B SaaS subscription model**.

### Pricing Tiers (Illustrative)
1.  **Professional Tier**:
    - **Price**: ~$5,000 / month / seat (for one PM).
    - **Features**: MVP functionality. Coverage of up to 50 US equities. Daily memo generation. Standard support.

2.  **Enterprise Tier**:
    - **Price**: ~$15,000 / month (flat fee for up to 5 seats).
    - **Features**: All Professional features, plus:
        - Expanded coverage (e.g., Russell 1000).
        - Higher frequency analysis (intraday).
        - API access.
        - Integration with existing portfolio management systems.
        - Dedicated support and onboarding.

## 3. Unit Economics
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**:
    - **Compute Costs**: Primarily LLM API calls (OpenAI) and cloud hosting (AWS). A single stock analysis memo might cost ~$0.10 in API calls with GPT-4o-mini. A fund tracking 50 stocks daily would cost ~$150/month in API fees.
    - **Data Costs**: Finnhub free tier for MVP. Post-MVP, premium data feeds will be the largest COGS component (~$1k-5k/month per source).
- **Gross Margin Target**: We aim for an 80-90% gross margin once at scale. In the early stages, it will be lower due to initial data licensing costs.
