# File 08: Risk and Compliance

## 1. Regulatory & Compliance Checklist

- **SEC/FINRA AI Rules**: The SEC's proposed rules focus on model risk governance, transparency, and mitigating conflicts of interest. FINRA's rules for algorithmic trading require robust supervision, testing, and control.
    - **Our Mitigation**: Our core "Explainable AI" feature is a key mitigator. We will build a comprehensive **Audit & Logging Module** that records every agent's output, data source, and the final decision-making rationale for every memo. This provides a clear, human-readable compliance trail.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with GDPR and CCPA, even if targeting US funds initially, as a best practice. Anonymize any personal data used in training or analysis.
- **Model Risk Governance (MRG)**: We will implement a formal MRG framework from day one.
    - **Key Pillars**:
        1.  **Model Validation**: A dedicated Quant Researcher will be responsible for independently validating the logic and performance of the agent-based models.
        2.  **Ongoing Monitoring**: We will track model performance drift and data quality in real-time.
        3.  **Documentation**: Every agent's purpose, data inputs, and limitations will be thoroughly documented.

## 2. Key Risks & Mitigations

- **Technical Risk**:
    - **Risk**: LLMs can hallucinate or produce financially nonsensical outputs. The orchestration of agents could fail.
    - **Mitigation**:
        1.  **Guardrail Agents**: Implement specialized agents to validate the outputs of other agents (e.g., a "Sanity Check" agent).
        2.  **Structured Outputs**: Use function calling and Pydantic models to force LLMs to return structured, validated data, not just free text.
        3.  **Rigorous Backtesting**: Extensively backtest the entire system's recommendations before deploying with any client.

- **Market Risk**:
    - **Risk**: The AI's strategies might underperform, leading to client churn. A market regime change could invalidate the models.
    - **Mitigation**:
        1.  **No Performance Guarantees**: Our legal agreements will clearly state we are a research augmentation tool, not a fiduciary promising returns.
        2.  **Diversity of Agents**: Build a diverse team of agents (e.g., including fundamental, technical, macro) to ensure strategies are not reliant on a single factor.
        3.  **Continuous Monitoring**: Use the Model Risk Governance framework to detect performance degradation.

- **Regulatory Risk**:
    - **Risk**: New, stricter regulations on AI in finance could be implemented.
    - **Mitigation**: Our emphasis on transparency and auditability is the best defense. We will engage with legal counsel specializing in fintech regulation.

- **Operational Risk**:
    - **Risk**: Over-reliance on a single LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI) or data provider (e.g., Finnhub).
    - **Mitigation**: Design the architecture to be model-agnostic. Create an abstraction layer that allows us to switch between different LLMs (e.g., Anthropic, Cohere, open-source) or data providers with minimal code changes.
