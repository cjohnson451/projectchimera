# File 09: Business Strategy

## 1. Success Metrics & KPIs

- **Product Adoption & Engagement**:
    - **Activation Rate**: % of new users who create a watchlist and review a memo in their first week.
    - **Weekly Active Users (WAU)**: Number of PMs logging in each week.
    - **Memo Interaction Rate**: % of generated memos that are opened and reviewed.

- **Trading Performance (Proxy for Value)**:
    - **Approval Hit Rate**: For 'Approved' trade ideas, what is the win rate over a 30-day period? (Tracked via backtesting, not real P&L).
    - **Sharpe Ratio of AI Recommendations**: The risk-adjusted return of the AI's simulated portfolio.

- **Business Health**:
    - **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) / Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**.
    - **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**.
    - **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**.
    - **Gross Churn Rate**: % of customers who cancel their subscription each month.

## 2. Funding Plan
- **Pre-Seed/Seed Round**:
    - **Capital Needed**: ~$2.5 Million.
    - **Use of Funds**: To reach the 12-18 month milestones. This covers ~24 months of runway for a team of 5-7 (salaries), plus data, compute, and legal costs.
    - **Target Investors**: VCs specializing in Fintech, AI/SaaS, and Enterprise software. Angels with deep experience in asset management or who are former fund managers.
- **Pitch Story Hook**: "Hedge funds spend billions on quant teams to get a competitive edge. We give them a 'Quant-Team-in-a-Box' for the price of a Bloomberg terminal, powered by transparent, explainable AI that they can actually trust."

## 3. Long-term Moat & Exit Scenarios

### 3.1. How We Defend and Win
Our long-term competitive moat is built on three pillars:
1.  **Proprietary Data & Insights Loop**: The more clients use our platform, the more data we gather on which AI strategies and reasoning chains lead to successful outcomes (based on their approvals/rejections and backtesting). This proprietary dataset will be used to continuously fine-tune our agents, creating a system that gets smarter over timeâ€”a classic data network effect.
2.  **Workflow Integration**: By moving from just providing memos to integrating with portfolio management systems (PMS) and execution management systems (EMS), we become deeply embedded in our clients' daily operations, making us difficult to replace.
3.  **Brand & Trust**: In finance, trust is paramount. By building the leading brand for transparent, auditable AI for investment management, we become the default choice for funds looking to adopt AI responsibly.

### 3.2. Potential Exit Scenarios
- **Acquisition by a Financial Data & Terminal Provider**: Companies like Bloomberg, FactSet, or Refinitiv would see us as a strategic acquisition to integrate a next-generation AI research capability into their flagship terminals.
- **Acquisition by a Major Asset Manager or Investment Bank**: A large firm like BlackRock or Goldman Sachs could acquire us to internalize the technology and deploy it across their own investment teams.
- **Acquisition by a Large Tech Company**: A major tech player like Microsoft, Google, or Amazon looking to deepen its footprint in the financial services vertical.
- **IPO**: A long-term possibility if we achieve significant scale ($100M+ in ARR) and become the market-leading platform in our category.
